<p><img src="dice_ticker.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Luck is common to all. While we curse our misfortune when it works against us, it mostly hides in a cognitive blind
    spot for the remainder of our experiences. It shouldn’t, for we essentially have no control over this world around
    us. It sound’s rather bleak to strip away all sense of freedom and autonomy. Yes, you think you have control, how
    could you not. You chose what discipline to study at university, you chose the colour of your car, you chose how
    your eggs were to be prepared for brunch. What is life but a stream of choices? And surely our lives are simply a
    culmination of those choices. But we do not live in isolated bubbles. Our wealth, our status, our being comes about
    through the functioning of the society in which we are members. Therefore, these measures of identity arise only
    after countless interactions of (mostly) self-serving agents, the majority of which are completely unaware of your
    existence. How much control does one have over this?</p>
<p>To be sure, within the short-term we can gauge the outcomes of a decision fairly accurately, allowing us to make
    appropriate choices (e.g. if I slap Dave, he’ll get pretty angry at me). Here, I will allow one to have pride in
    their forecasting abilities. Now as we extend out our timescale of consideration, magnification of errors and
    stochastic societal interactions start overwhelming any predictions we might make. If you made a critical decision
    and 10 years down the line your prediction of its outcome proved correct, it is my assumption (and the very nature
    of this piece) that this is essentially random chance, not divine prescience. Additionally, we can never replay a
    certain situation ad infinitum to observe the numerous outcomes so similarly possible. As such, we can never know
    what alternative realities we might have encountered, and what other fortunes (or misfortunes) our decisions might
    have provided.</p>
<p>The most insidious consequence our disregard for luck has is in wealth creation, and its subsequent lack of
    redistribution. The issue at the core of this endemic problem is that all of us feel like we earned and, thus,
    deserve every dollar deposited into our bank account. Such thinking predisposes us to look upon the indigent as less
    ambitious, less dedicated and less deserving. But is luck the simple force which causes this graduation between
    those on the streets and those in the Mercedes? Any discussion of luck is a discussion of probabilities, which
    cannot always be accurately summarised by a single number. A distribution of numbers (be it incomes, net worth etc.)
    better reflects the reality of the situation and the underlying factors responsible. The distribution of high wealth
    levels has been noted as following a power function called a Pareto distribution, describing the fact that the
    majority of the wealth is largely held by a small fraction. Using numerical simulations, <a
        href="www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003465303322369830?journalCode=rest">Levy &amp; Levy</a>
    demonstrate that the shape of the Pareto distribution arises when luck, as opposed to any sort of investment talent,
    is the significant factor driving wealth creation. As the influence of investment talent increases with respect to
    luck, the shape of the resultant distribution changes from that which is actually observed within society.</p>
<p>Even when considering distributions of wealth, it is very possible that one reading could believe what is true for
    others is not true for them. They are not just lucky, they actually contributed value to society (in proportion to
    their compensation, of course). An easy target here is to consider the higher wage employment found in the sector of
    financial services. Here the value of one’s work becomes at best nebulous, at worst negligible. A <a
        href="https://www.kauffman.org/entrepreneurship/reports/we-have-met-the-enemy-and-he-is-us/">summary of The
        Koffman Foundation’s 20 year record with venture capitalist funds</a> demonstrated that, on average, such
    investments failed to yield better returns than simply acquiring small cap equity in the stock market (giving annual
    returns of 3-5%). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0732-8516.2005.00090.x">Examination of
        mutual funds</a> show that those which are actively managed by highly paid specialised experts underperform
    simple passive index funds over 1, 10 and 30 year periods. Any few actively managed funds which outperformed index
    funds in a given time period then underperformed in the subsequent time periods, indicating past performance is not
    a reliable indicator of future performance. In the examination of VCs and actively managed mutual funds, <a
        href="http://hkbeta.morningstar.com/ods_images/2015Jun_Morningstar%20Active-Passive%20Barometer.pdf">those which
        demanded the highest fees from investors performed the worst</a>. Remember, we are considering richly paid
    professionals whose very job asks them to maximise returns, and are very much financially incentivised to do so.
    Despite their high incomes, the efforts of participants in this arena are, on average, essentially worthless. So
    think twice when considering the actual value you are contributing.</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is the unlucky conditions which leads those away from the fortunes others have so
    miraculously fallen upon. How do people go through life and end up on the street? it is easy to derive their
    situation from the concatenation of poor life choices, but this too ignores any role of chance as a force on their
    life. Approximately a third of the homeless have some form of mental illness. How easy would you imagine it is for a
    severe schizophrenic to sit and study through 3-7 years of university, and maintain a decades-long corporate career?
    Outside of this effect, familial relations and structural effects, such as availability of low-income housing, also
    act to determine one’s fate on the street. The minutia of an individuals story plays an important role in where they
    fall on the ladder of society. As these factors, good and bad, are down to the role of the dice, those which have
    won the proverbial lottery should be more open to distributing their winnings to the similarly chanced losers.</p>
<p>As an addendum, what I find most offensive about this ignorance of chance is how devoid of critical thought it all
    is. A scientist is required to gather the most robust set of data to develop their inductions. If there is an
    element of randomness or uncertainty, this must be quantified and included in the model. I can’t ever expect the
    world to employ the same scientific rigour to every problem. But If we get used to picking and choosing what
    information we use to inform our outlook of the world, then this confirmation bias will bleed into other parts of
    our lives; most worryingly, our political stances and then the policies imposed by these parties. That’s some poor
    luck for society.</p>
