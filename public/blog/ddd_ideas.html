Domain-Driven Design</h1>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-13 07:00">13th Jan 2025</time></p>
<p>What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD)? I used to group it with the other
programming acronyms (TDD, SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY, etc.). Maybe
something developers <em>should</em> practice, but often don’t. That
changed after I read Vaughn Vernon’s book <a
href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-domain-driven-design/9780133039900/"><strong>Implementing
Domain Driven Design</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As developers, we are told what constitutes “good code”. There should
be high cohesion, low coupling, single responsibilities, information
hiding, and so on. But these ideas are abstract. While the benefit of
these characteristics are clear, it’s not always obvious how to achieve
them. Well, DDD is one way how. It describes a number of patterns that
will help you write clearer, less coupled, extensible, cohesive code
that aligns strongly with the business’ goals.</p>
<p>A core tenet is that your code should model the domain you are
building a solution for. If a business process change is conceptually
simple, so is the required code change. No more explaining to a product
manager why a basic feature request will actually take weeks to
implement. I am relatively new to this methodology. So I won’t provide a
more detailed description than that. Instead, I will share some useful
DDD patterns I’ve come across. These are good general programming
practices. You don’t need to “do” DDD to follow these. But if you think
they are insightful, I would encourage you to checkout the resources <a
href="#further-reading">listed at the end</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Some useful DDD patterns:</strong><br/> 1. <a
href="#understand-what-youre-building-and-why">Understand what you’re
building, and why.</a><br/> 2. <a
href="#understand-your-relationship-with-other-services">Understand your
relationship with other services.</a><br/> 3. <a
href="#understand-the-type-of-object-youre-creating">Understand the type
of object you’re creating.</a><br/> 4. <a

Objects.</a><br/> 5. <a href="#use-rich-domain-models">Use rich domain
models.</a><br/> 6. <a
href="#hide-your-domain-models-from-the-outside-world">Hide your domain
models from the outside world.</a><br/></p>
<h2 id="understand-what-youre-building-and-why">Understand what you’re
building, and why</h2>
<p>Don’t make assumptions about what you’re building. Discuss and
explore it with the domain expert. This could be your product manager or
clients. Through this collaboration, both the technical and
non-technical team members will better understand their business, user
needs, and value they are delivering. The process of exploration may
even help the domain experts uncover areas of uncertainty. Plan and
design. Do not immediately jump into coding.</p>
<p>Part of this process involves the creation of a <strong>Ubiquitous
Language</strong>, a shared language describing the domain. A common
approach for this modelling process is <a
href="https://www.eventstorming.com/">Event Storming</a>. The
<strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> is used by both domain experts and
within the codebase. As Vaughn Vernon writes in <strong>Implementing
Domain-Driven Design</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should build software that is as close as possible to what the
business leaders and experts would create if they were the coders… There
are zero translations between the domain experts, the software
developers, and the software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine an application for booking tickets at a cinema. What’s a good
name for a function that saves the finalised booking in the backend?
Should the method be <code>createBooking</code> or
<code>confirmBooking</code>? The word “create” leaks developer knowledge
into the codebase. They know a new record is being created in the
database. And, ultimately, that is what this function does. But the name
<code>confirmBooking</code> better describes the real life use case.
“Create” is not the verb a customer would associate with the
confirmation step of the booking process.</p>
<h2 id="understand-your-relationship-with-other-services">Understand
your relationship with other services</h2>
<p>Before designing a service, take a moment to understand how it fits
into your wider technology ecosystem. Some services exist to support
unrelated parts of the business. And there are services that your new
service will need to interact with. Understanding this space is called
<strong>Context Mapping</strong>. You might incidentally do this when
designing a new system. However, for DDD it is an <em>explicit</em>
process. It goes so far as to characterise the relationships
underpinning these services. Below are a few examples. Check out more at
<a href="https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping">this useful
repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="partnership">Partnership</h4>
<p>The upstream and downstream teams succeed or fail together. Models
and interfaces are developed to suit both their needs and any features
and planned between them to minimise harm.</p>
<h4 id="customer-supplier-development">Customer-Supplier
Development</h4>
<p>The success of the upstream team (the supplier) is independent of the
downstream team. But they take the downstream’s needs into account when
planning.</p>
<h4 id="conformist">Conformist</h4>
<p>The upstream team does not accommodate the downstream team’s needs.
The downstream team conforms to the models of the upstream team,
whatever they are or change to.</p>
<p>A lot of confusion and frustration might be avoided if these
relationships are agreed between participating teams ahead of time.</p>
<h2 id="understand-the-type-of-object-youre-creating">Understand the
type of object you’re creating</h2>
<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), our codebases are full of
classes. These are often loosely categorised into vague concepts like
services and repositories. However, these categories and their
definitions vary from one project (or developer) to the next. So in each
new codebase, we spend time understanding the responsibilities of each
class.</p>
<p>Without formal definitions, it is easy for the scope of these classes
to grow. And then the level of abstraction becomes lost. Fortunately,
DDD provides concrete definitions for model categories, and rules for
how they can interact. The vocabulary is simple, yet empowering. When
you don’t have to define the building blocks of your application, you
can focus more on what you’re building. These are the “tactical
patterns” of DDD. Some examples are:</p>
<h4 id="value-objects">Value Objects</h4>
<p>Immutable objects that represent a value with no identity. These can
be replaced, but cannot change, over time. Two <strong>Value
Objects</strong> are considered equal if they hold the same values
(i.e. structural equality).</p>
<h4 id="entities">Entities</h4>
<p>Objects that have a unique identity. Two <strong>Entities</strong>
with the same identifier are considered equal, even if all other
properties are different in value. These represent concepts in your
domain that you need to observe and track changes to over time.</p>
<h4 id="aggregates">Aggregates</h4>
<p>These are a grouping of <strong>Entities</strong> and <strong>Value
Objects</strong> that represent a consistency boundary. If there is some
invariant or business rule that must be maintained when updating a group
of objects (and rolled back everywhere upon failure), then they belong
together in an <strong>Aggregate</strong>. One <strong>Entity</strong>
will serve as the <strong>Aggregate Root</strong>, through which all
behaviour is orchestrated.</p>
<p>What if another <strong>Entity</strong> is changed at the same time
as the <strong>Aggregate</strong>? If there is no requirement to
maintain consistency between the two objects (and <em>really</em>
challenge yourself on this point!) then it shouldn’t be part of the
<strong>Aggregate</strong>. Instead, it can be updated through an
event-driven process that is eventually consistent. The goal is to make
each <strong>Aggregate</strong> as lightweight as possible.</p>
<h4 id="domain-services">Domain Services</h4>
<p>A <strong>Domain Service</strong> helps realise business logic and
coordinates actions between your domain models
(i.e. <strong>Aggregates</strong>). Importantly, only use <strong>Domain
Services</strong> when the behaviour being orchestrated cannot logically
belong to a single <strong>Aggregate</strong> (see <a
href="#use-rich-domain-models">below</a>).</p>
<h4 id="application-services">Application Services</h4>
<p>These allow your domain logic to interface with the external world
(API, persistence stores, etc). No business logic belongs here. Each
method represents a single business use case. And each method achieves
its goal by interacting with the <strong>Aggregates</strong> and
<strong>Domain Services</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="use-immutable-value-objects">Use immutable Value Objects</h2>
<p>Try using <strong>Value Objects</strong> where ever possible.
Replacing both primitives and classes with <strong>Value
Objects</strong> will make your code more self-documenting, easier to
maintain, and less prone to bugs.</p>
<p>Let us consider a Kotlin application for booking tickets at a cinema.
Perhaps it was first written like below.</p>

<p>We can improve this by introducing <strong>Value Objects</strong>.
<strong>Value Objects</strong> are immutable, so we replace all use of
<code>var</code> with <code>val</code>. And we use
<code>data class</code> to enable structural equality when comparing
objects. The same can be achieved by record classes in Java and data
classes in Python.</p>

<p>These changes introduce a number of benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Improved readability</strong><br/> Each type actually means
something in our domain. They are not primitives. Also, related concepts
can be grouped together. For example, all aspects of the seating
location (theatre, row, seat number) are grouped into the
<code>Seat</code> class. This improves readability and reduces the
number of method parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Better type safety</strong><br/> Now it’s harder to
accidentally swap the order of the method parameters that previously had
the same type (i.e. <code>UUID</code>). For static languages, the
compiler will complain if the value for <code>customerId</code> and
<code>cinemeaId</code> are swapped. For dynamic programming languages,
such errors can now be caught by the linter (if you use one).</p>
<p><strong>Improved evolvability.</strong><br/> What if we want to
change the data type representing an identifier (e.g. change the cinema
identifier to <code>Int</code> )? Previously, we would need to update
<em>all</em> class and function definitions using that identifier. Now
we only need to update a few lines in the <code>CinemaIdentifier</code>
class.</p>
<p><strong>Validation</strong><br/> Basic data validation is included in
the <strong>Value Object</strong> construction. This is much better than
scattering around (and possibly repeating) validation in the methods the
data is used. It improves reliability, because the data is
<em>guaranteed</em> to be validated. And it improves readability, as the
business logic can now focus on the use case.</p>
<p><strong>Immutability</strong><br/> <strong>Value Objects</strong> are
immutable. Once one is instantiated and validated, you know it is valid,
always. Because <strong>Value Objects</strong> are immutable, any
methods are side-effect free. <strong>Value Objects</strong> can be
passed around a multi-threaded application with confidence.</p>
<h2 id="use-rich-domain-models">Use rich domain models</h2>
<p>Don’t compose your application with only weak (or anaemic) domain
models. These are classes that hold data but don’t include any business
logic. The result is that all logic is pushed into what developers often
labelled “services” (but these are different to the DDD definition of
Services <a href="#entities">provided above</a>).</p>
<p>For an application with anaemic domain models, a developer might
write a class like below to perform the business logic.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with this? Well, the term “booking service” is pretty
vague. It currently handles the logic for the creation, modification,
and cancellation of a single booking. But should it include logic for
listing historical bookings made by a customer? Or searching for a
particular booking? Hmm, maybe, but possibly not… Regardless, if a
product manager requests this functionality, I bet the logic will be
added to this class. And through this process the class grows in scope
and loses cohesion. And each new functionality will require more
injected dependencies. Over time this scope creep creates <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">God Classes</a>.</p>
<p>What is the alternative? In DDD domain models aren’t necessarily
simple data holders. They represent a core concept in your domain. Thus,
they should not only hold the data, but also the behaviours that involve
that data. These are called rich domain models.</p>
<p>In the previous section I treated the <code>BookingDetails</code> as
a <strong>Value Object</strong>. But if we put our DDD hats on, we can
see a booking is actually better modelled as an <strong>Entity</strong>.
That’s because each booking is unique. It is a <em>thing</em> that can
be updated over its life. Thus we need to track it with a unique
identifier. With some minor adjustments, we can improve our booking
service from before.</p>

<p>Our booking class clearly represents a single booking, and actions
associated with it. It is unlikely a future developer would bastardise
this class by adding methods like <code>getAllBookings</code> or
<code>findBooking</code>. Thus, we have better preserved the cohesion of
our codebase going into the future. And maximising the maintainability
of a codebase is critical for any long-lived application. There is no
longer a “create” function, as this is simply performed through the act
of instantiating the class. And the actions that can be made on this
<strong>Entity</strong> are clearly defined by the class methods.
Instead of the vague <code>updateBooking</code> class, we have
<code>changeSeats</code>. The code reflects the actual use case and
tells the developer why it’s there.</p>
<h2 id="hide-your-domain-models-from-the-outside-world">Hide your domain
models from the outside world</h2>
<p>All projects have dependencies for communicating with the outside
world. These could help serve RESTful endpoints, communicate with other
services via RPC, or connect to a database. While necessary, none of
this has anything to do with the purpose of the service. So, there is no
reason to couple these external dependencies to this core business
logic. This principle is often referred to as <a
href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">clean
architecture</a>. DDD is not the only proponent of this style. But, with
its strong emphasis on considered domain models, it does scream out for
such an approach.</p>
<p>Any layered architecture can achieve the separation of concerns
required for clean architecture. My favourite is the Ports and Adapters
(i.e. Hexagonal) style. It strongly promotes the use of clean domain
models. The “ports” surround your core logic and serve as points of
entry to your application. These ports are typically defined as
interfaces. The concrete implementations of these interfaces are the
“adapters” that leverage libraries and other dependencies to serve their
function.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ddd_clean_architecture.png" />
<figcaption>
An illustration of the Ports and Adapters architecture, where arrows
point in the direction of depenceny. If needed, we can easily change our
datastore from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. Inbound and outbound ports don’t
only interface with APIs and databases. This is only an example.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What’s wrong with a simple three-layer architecture, with a
presentation, application, and data-access layer? If done well, nothing.
But, particularly if combined with an object-relational mapping (ORM)
framework, it can enable developers to take shortcuts. These reduce the
maintainability of the project over its life. For example, with the ORM
classes it is possible for the presentation layer to directly interact
with the database. And a lazy developer might choose to do this for a
simple CRUD operation, instead of passing data unnecessarily through the
application layer. Over time, such a shortcut might occur for another
reason. And then again, and again. The result is logic spread over all
the layers of your application, defeating the original purpose of the
layered architecture.</p>
<p>Further, ORMs promote database driven design. It’s easier to pretend
your ORM classes are the core models of your application. But that means
your “model” actually reflects how the data is organised in the
database, not how it’s represented in real life. And if these ORM
classes are used as your core “models”, then good luck ever switching
frameworks down the line. The ORM dependency is now tightly coupled to
all your logic. You will effectively need to re-write your entire
application. I have also seen the same mistake occur for gRPC generated
data access classes. Best use a clean architecture and leave these
dependencies out of your core business logic 😌</p>
