<p>Over its turbulent years, the 20th century yielded a number of
technological breakthroughs which laid bare a new paradigm for the next
millennium. Here the brute power of mechanical automatons found
competition in the more nuanced comprehension of information theory and
computation. The gestation of these concepts eventually yielded a new
model for sharing information and birthed the internet, a final gift to
the new world ahead. Each of the steps leading to this moment relied on
significant technological achievements. The work of Alan Turing and
Claude Shannon helped formalise the modern idea of a computer and its
universal potential. Equally necessary was the translation of its early
mechanical inception to a digital, semiconductor composition, owed
largely to the work at AT&amp;T Bell labs (of which Claude Shannon also
happened to be an employee). From here, several companies, such as
Fairchild Semiconductor and Texas Instruments, skilfully wove these
single transistors into a tapestry of integrated circuits, seemingly
capable of much more than the simple boolean algebra on which they were
operating. Up until this point in the story, what one would consider
“tech” is largely forged in the disciplines of science, engineering and
mathematics. Any advancement relied heavily on expertise in these fields
and all those participating were of the same ilk.</p>
<p>In the years since, these once defined boundaries have blurred.
Naturally, the growing complexity of computers necessitated
specialisation, making the software engineer an entirely legitimate and
imperative role within relevant organisations. More broadly though, the
perception of tech within the social consciousness has been warped by a
wave of irrelevant start ups. The driving force behind this is closer to
the greed of the 80’s yuppies than the intellectual pursuit of the
industry’s creators. Now what we consider tech is an amalgamation of
marketing, gambling and ecommerce. San Fransisco has been blighted by a
swarm of intelligent, young, ambitious, technically brilliant graduates
looking to score a job at… <a

from dazzling, there are many entrepreneurial spirits are out there on
their own. Looking to make a genuine impact in the world by creating the
next… <a href="https://about.pinterest.com/en">Pintrest</a>, <a

href="http://duettoresearch.com/gamechanger/">Duetto</a>. The majority
of companies touting revolution more closely imitate iteration (and in
the smallest degree). The buzzword of innovation has been diluted down
to improving UX and including additional swipe gestures. The biggest
names of this recent flourish, such as AirBnb and Uber, who’s profit
margins indicate they are actually providing a useful product, are
simply a 21st century adaptation of previous industries. The difference
largely lies in their parasitic appropriation of the “sharing economy”
mantra to minimise overheads and shift risk to the consumers.</p>
<p>If we expand our scope of observation only slightly, the mobile
gaming industry appears on our periphery. I have no qualms with gaming
in general, but what’s flooding our mobiles could more accurately be
described as pokie machines thinly veiled by a well trodden gameplay
mechanism. The most clear example is the Candy Crush phenomenon. A
simple match-three puzzle game, Candy Crush is more or less a port of
Bejewelled (which probably was copied itself) into a modern day setting.
Yet it has accrued its creators literally billions of dollars. The same
disparity between originality and profitability can be said for Flappy
Bird, Words with Friends and a whole host of inductees to the Apple and
Android app store. At best these developers are merely providing a way
for the public to kill time, which is not in itself entirely harmful
(though not productive either). More cynically, they are deliberately
employing the psychology of addiction to garner return customers pouring
their dollars towards digital trinkets.</p>
<p>Overall, the current state of affairs was succinctly put by Jeff
Hammerbacher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make
people click ads”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are impressive companies with lofty ambitions, trying to make
an impact in the world (thank you Elon Musk), but a brain drain towards
more frivolous endeavours is impeding progress. Labelling all the above
examples as “tech”, which itself has gained a reverence probably
ill-deserved, imbues such career options as equally nobel uses of one’s
gifts. As a collective, we must stop hyping the relative mundaneness of
a taxi-calling app, and recalibrate our perspective. Otherwise, after
spending a century setting the foundation and infrastructure, paving a
roadmap towards our future enlightenment, we’ll remain pulled over on
the dusty side road, checking out the bright lights of the carnival just
passed.</p>
