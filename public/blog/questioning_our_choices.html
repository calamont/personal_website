<p>A unifying concept between neuroscience and physics is how the great
questions in each field boldly attempt to unravel the mystery and
fundamental nature of reality. Of course the routes follow divergent
paths, with physics focusing on the externalities, such as what is time,
space, matter and how did it all begin, while neuroscience has
internalised the problem. What is free will? What is consciousness? Do
they really exist and, if so, how could either arise from a complex, yet
conceptually simple interconnection of nerve cells? And similarly in
both fields we are still quite a distance from any satisfying answers.
To some, these quandaries about our minds may appear academic. Indeed,
from our subjective experience, the idea of free will and consciousness
are self-evident. How could they not exist? Though these topics are
somewhat intertwined, the arguments countering each are worthy of their
own discussion. For today, that discussion will be limited to free
will.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of our identity as human beings is the concept of free
will. While other animals may appear to simply respond to their
surroundings on a base, instinctual and unconsidered manner, we are
capable of far greater reasoning and insight. We parse an influx of
complex information and “choose” what we consider to be the best course
of action. While this is our experience, much of our decision making may
actually occur at a level removed from us. <a
href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472609.Critical_Mass">Phillip
Ball’s Critical Mass</a> provides an overarching take on the idea that
many behaviours resulting from our decisions can be seen to follow
consistent rules, despite any fluctuations on an individual scale. These
rules and behaviours can then be interpreted using previously developed
models in physics. One useful analogy is to consider the gas laws. It is
impossible to track the motion and interactions of trillions of gas
molecules in any given volume, yet with statistics we are able to very
accurately predict the overall behaviour of the collection of molecules.
Now applying the same concept to human behaviour, we have been able to
realistically model situations which should be influenced by our will,
including traffic flow, the rise of firms in the economy, the growth of
city borders and even collective herding behaviour in voting. What does
this say about the nature of our capability of choice? At the very
least, we can state that, in certain situations, there seems an
underlying universality in our minds driving our decisions. Some of the
arguments given are in constrained settings, where there is already a
set of rules imposed on our choices (such as the effect of road laws on
traffic). This might limit what conclusions may be drawn but,
nevertheless, it opens the door for discussion and encourages us to
probe this question further. Craig Reynolds’ boids algorithm illustrates
how complex behaviour can emerge through the application of a few simple
rules. Swarms of agents seem to coordinate and flock together, though
the basis of this behaviour is underpinned by three guidelines. Each
agent’s location and speed are updated to reflect the average position
and velocity of those surrounding it. Additionally, agents try to
maintain a distance from their neighbours.</p>

<p>The concept of free will is at odds with the efforts of science to
describe the unending cascade of cause and effect, rippling outward
since the creation of the universe. If the particles of which we are
made are equatable to a sequence of falling dominoes, then how can our
agency be anything but an illusion? Who are we to think we are not
subject to such axioms of reality. This determinism ultimately leads to
the viewpoint famously conjectured by Laplace</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of
its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An
intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant,
as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would
be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest
bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its
intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to
it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be
present to its eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much has changed since the days of Laplace, most notably is the ever
confounding idea of quantum mechanics and the uncertainty which it
entails. However, these mechanics can still be condensed into
probability density functions which, on average, can speak to the
interactions and motions of atoms. Thus, the concept of an omnipotent
all-knowing intelligence, calculating the fate of the universe, still
carries weight, as does any other argument countering free will. If this
is truly so, then the question to naturally arise is why do we think we
have free will? Though it defies intuition, it may simply be an illusion
created by our minds. Indeed, the world we experience is forever edited
and manipulated by our brains to ensure it coincides with our
expectations. If you touch your nose and your toe at the same time you
will sense this at both locations together. However, the length of time
required for the signals to reach your brain from your toe is notably
different to that from your nose. Our brain processes the information so
that what we consciously perceive falls in line with our knowledge of
what we should experience. Synchronicity is also often maintained
between our auditory and visual senses, despite their dissimilar
processing speeds. Our minds are also capable of filling blanks in the
canvas of our reality. A classic example is that of the phi phenomenon,
in which the sensation of motion can be induced by a series of still
images, and which underpins the theory of film. These examples provide a
good foundation to the concept that our conscious experience is not
necessarily a faithful reproduction of the real world around us.
Professor Donald Hoffman goes further to suggest that more accurate
renderings of reality are <a
href="http://cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/ShapeFitness.pdf">less likely to
endure the selective pressures of evolution</a>. Hoffman, a Professor of
Cognitive Science at University of California, explains this through the
added computational costs and resources required to interpret a more
truthful representation of our world. What we are left with is a system
of senses which are simply “good enough”.</p>
<p>It is evident that our minds have the ability to mislead us about us
about our surroundings, but can it go a step further to deceive itself?
Simply, yes, as demonstrated by Anton–Babinski syndrome. A relatively
rare condition, patients afflicted are adamant they are able to see
despite being blind. Wrapping one’s head around such an thought can be
difficult. What are they seeing if blind? Is this analogous to our
determined stance on free will? The delusionary power of the mind is
startling. This is further encountered with the concept of the left
brain interpreter, a theory initially formed through studies of split
brain patients, in which communication between the two hemispheres was
severed. In the studies, patients were instructed to perform a task only
through their left visual field (correlating to the right hemisphere of
the brain), which the left-hemisphere was oblivious to. When enquired
about their response, the left-hemisphere was able to construct an
explanation as to why the action was taken, despite being unaware of the
command given to the right-hemisphere. Such findings have been proven to
hold true in the population at large, with brains more or less in tact.
Therefore, our perception of free-will may likely be an artefact of this
seemingly innate ability of the brain to create a narrative for the
automated, unconscious and reflexive responses of our subconscious.
Naturally, such a weighty conclusion necessitates more substantial
evidence. However, even if this were brought to the fore, with advancing
techniques to probe the brain and its circuitry, we would be no closer
to fitting such an awkwardly shaped puzzle piece into our delineated
architecture of society. What is right and wrong in the face of
determinism? Can any individual be held to account for their actions?
These questions seem equally complex to the ruminations which led to
their arrival. Although, unlike matters in science, where a glimmer of
closure can be found in a result, it may be so that these queries have
no correct answer.</p>
