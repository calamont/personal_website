      <p>
        Hey ðŸ‘‹ I'm Callum, A software engineer from Melbourne, Australia.
        <br />
        <br />
        First, a quick bio. After my undergrad I moved to London for a PhD in Biomedical
        Engineering. This was a great experience, but I decided academia was not for me. So I
        transitioned to a job in machine learning at a startup. Now I am a backend software engineer
        and genuinely love learning about databases, clean code, vim, and how to not let stand ups
        blow out to 40 minutes every morning.
        <br />
        <br />I also love playing guitar, learning spanish, and cooking. Hit me up if you're ever in
        Melbourne!
