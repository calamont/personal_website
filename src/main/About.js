        Well heck...<br /><br />

        Took you long enough to find this site and say hi!<br /><br />

        Over on the sidebar is my collection of random side projects I've been toying around with. Also got there a few bits of writings that I scribbled down when feeling serious. Click around and see if anything takes your fancy. More detail is given in the README docs for each section.<br /><br />

        I'm not one for shameless self promotion, so if want to know more about me see my <a href="https://github.com/calamont">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/callum-lamont">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=callum+lamont">Google search results</a>.<br /><br />

        Have a merry day ✌️<br />
